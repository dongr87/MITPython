Opening Files with the open() Function
To open a file with the open() function, you pass it a string path indicating the file you want to open; it can be either an absolute or relative path. The open() function returns a File object.

Try it by creating a text file named hello.txt using Notepad or TextEdit. Type Hello world! as the content of this text file and save it in your user home folder. Then, if you¡¯re using Windows, enter the following into the interactive shell:


>>> helloFile = open('C:\\Users\\your_home_folder\\hello.txt')
If you¡¯re using OS X, enter the following into the interactive shell instead:


>>> helloFile = open('/Users/your_home_folder/hello.txt')
